On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major stock indexes rose in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments. Nvidia shares rebounded by 3.4% following a four-day losing streak, while Tesla shares declined by 1.9%, snapping a three-day win streak after hitting record highs. The 10-year Treasury yield increased to 4.41%, and oil prices rose nearly 1%, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading at around $70.75 per barrel. Wall Street is expecting a hawkish Fed meeting outcome, suggesting a likely end to rate cuts after a probable third cut.
