The S&P 500 increased by 0.3%, near its record high, the Dow Jones by 0.5%, and the Nasdaq by 0.3%. Notably, Jabil's shares surged 8.4% following strong quarterly earnings and an improved revenue forecast, while Nvidia rebounded by 4.3%. Conversely, General Mills dropped 2.8% despite positive earnings, due to increased brand investment impacting profit forecasts.
